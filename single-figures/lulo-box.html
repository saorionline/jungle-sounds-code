    World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.
    It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military
     alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from
      more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities
       behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major
        role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear
        weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million
         fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides
         (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat,
         Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
   
    The exact causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War,
    the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in
    Europe and rising European tensions since World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on
    1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently
    declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union
     had partitioned Poland and marked out their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
     Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much
     of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with other countries later on).
     Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war
     continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial
     Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European
     Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.
